<p>About the last season of Bigg Boss Telugu
In the fourth season of Bigg Boss Telugu, which aired in the second half of 2020, saw a thrilling finale 
where Alekhya Harika was evicted first, followed by Ariyana Glory. Syed Sohel Ryan accepted an offer of 
Rs 25 lakh instead of the trophy and exited the show. Then, the fans’ anticipation came to an end when
 Abijeet Duddala was crowned the winner of Bigg Boss Telugu 4.
The finale episode, which was telecasted on 20 December 2021, created
viewership records and hugely entertained the audience. Considering the fact that the fourth season of
the show began in September 2020, it is being expected that the same window will be utilised for Season 5. 
The contestant list of the new season is yet to be announced, along with the dates, but the buzz is brewing among
the fans with the first look reveal and it shouldn’t be long before the Season 5 of Bigg Boss Telugu is here.

<p>
Post the humongous success of Bigg Boss Telugu 4, mini-screen audiences are now eagerly awaiting the 
show's new season. As expected, superstar Nagarjuna Akkineni will be returning with the fifth instalment 
of the popular reality show. Speculations on social media suggest that Bigg Boss Telugu 5 will most likely 
premiere from September 2021.
